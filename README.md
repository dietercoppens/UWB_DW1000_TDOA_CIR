## UWB DW1000 TDOA Channel Impulse Response dataset
UWB dataset for fingerprinting and/or TDoA correction using Channel Impulse Responses received at the anchors.

# Dataset description
This dataset contains multiple trajectories in an industrial environment with accurate ground truth data measured using a Motion-Capture system.
For every position the CIRs to the anchors in reach is available together with a received timestamp. The clocks of the different anchors were synchronized to allow for time difference of arrival (TDoA) positioning.

# Availability
The dataset will become available once the corresponding paper is published
